# Monetization-Model
The aim of this project is to analyse:  the App user, user journey, different types of users, customer acqusition costs. In order to be able to propose an effective monetization model for an app.


1. The data analysed was collected in the period between 2020-05-04 00:00:01 and 2020-06-05 12:32:49
The number of users participating in the analysed cohort: 13 576

2. On average, it takes a user 11 days 13 hr 28 min to finish Stage 1 and a typical user would build 11 buildings before finishing Stage 1.

3. It takes more time for users to finish Stage 1 by building Satellite Orbital Assembly.

4. Users who build Satellite Orbital Assembly build more buildings than those who defeat the first boss.

In order to check whether it takes the average number of building built by users who finished stage 1 by Satellite Orbital Assembly or by defeating the first boss is the same, we will use test for comparing two population means.

The significance level chosen for this test is 0.05

H0= Average number of building built by users who finished stage 1 by Satellite Orbital Assembly or by defeating the first boss is the same;

H1= Average number of building built by users who finished stage 1 by Satellite Orbital Assembly or by defeating the first boss is different.

Recommendations:

Users who build Satellite Orbital Assembly may be more profitable users in terms of ad viewing due to the higher number of events initiated by them in the events and longer time needed in order to complete stage 1.



It is recommended to divert Facebook ads budget towards Google Play ads.

Porposed Monetization Model: CPM (Cost per Mille) with an ad showing each time a user initiate an event- building.

It is suggested to test the income from ad-viewing once the monetization model is implemented.
